<p>contoh_project has features such as bootstrap, retrieving data from a .json file with the $_POST method then displaying it again in table form in the interface display</p>
<p><h3>3. project_akhir</h3>
project_akhir is a task given so that the mentor knows that we have met the minimum criteria for web programming, with a directory arrangement like this:</p>
